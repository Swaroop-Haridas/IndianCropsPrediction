# IndianCropsPrediction

This file is a Python script that explores crop yield data from India. It reads a CSV file with information on crops, their production, area, annual rainfall, fertilizer use, pesticide application, and yields for various years across different states. The script performs basic operations such as displaying the head of the DataFrame, calculating grouped sums using groupby, visualizing the data with Matplotlib, checking for null values, and summarizing duplicates within the dataset.
